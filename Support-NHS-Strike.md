    # Watch our workshop

    ### Click here: [Picket line conversations on health and climate justice](https://youtu.be/LRnXpkpLlKU)

    How do you start conversations to connect health workers concerns with climate justice on the picket line? How do you link the climate crisis with cost of living crisis & the workers' demands? What are the pitfalls to avoid?

    Join this training to gain tips and confidence in having those conversations. This session will pay particular attention to the connections between health and climate justice to support your conversations and show solidarity on the picket lines.

    # Solidarity Actions

    Itâ€™s a really hard decision for NHS nurses and ambulance workers to go out on strike. They want to be on the frontline saving lives, not standing out on the cold picket lines. We need to show them we are with them through a massive wave of public support and warm gratitude.

    Don't see anything planned where you live yet? Scroll on to get everything you need to organise some solidarity (and warm solidari-tea & biscuits!) for NHS nurses where you live.
