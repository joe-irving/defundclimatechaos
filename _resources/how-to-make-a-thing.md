At 6pm from Friday 29th October until the end of the Glasgow climate talks, thousands of people around the country will light a lantern for climate justice. Here’s how to make your own and join us.

## What you’ll need:

* Large glass jar(s) with straight sides
* Some wire, ribbon or pipe cleaners for handles
* Battery powered fairy lights or tea lights
* Defund Climate Chaos newspaper or your own tissue paper and printed images.
* White glue
* Paintbrush and scissors

## Method:

### Step one - Design your lantern

* Think about the climate crisis, the people, places and things that you want to protect - something personal to you.
* Create a design mixing colours, words and images that will shine through lantern.
* Prepare your materials, eg. using strips of coloured tissue paper, cut outs from this newspaper, pens and thin paper.

### Step 2 - Make your lantern

* Wash and dry your jar
* Attach a handle around the rim of your lantern
* Paint a thin layer of glue on the outside of the jar with a paintbrush
* Place your design elements where you want them
* Cover with a final layer of glue and leave to dry

### Step 3 - Light your lantern at 6pm

Just days before world leaders gather in Glasgow for last-chance COP26 climate talks, memorials will be laid outside some of the UK institutions with the most outsized impact on fuelling the climate crisis: banks, insurers and investors who fund fossil fuels.

* Tell your friends and neighbours and encourage them to make lanterns too
* At 6pm on Friday 29th October, light your lantern for the first time - in your window, on your doorstep or at one of several [vigils and memorial events](https://defundclimatechaos.uk/#map).
  * If you want to join with others, organise your own memorial
* Take a picture or short video of yourself and your lantern and share it online

We invite you to light your lantern for climate justice every evening from Friday 29th until the end of the COP26 climate talks on November 12th.
