At 6pm from Friday 29th October until the end of the Glasgow climate talks, thousands of people around the country will light a lantern to shine light on their hopes for climate justice. 

Here’s how to make your own and join in.

## What you’ll need:

* Large glass jar(s) with straight sides
* Some wire, ribbon or pipe cleaners for handles
* Battery powered fairy lights or tea lights
* [Defund Climate Chaos newspaper]() or your own tissue paper and printed images on thin paper.
* White glue
* Paintbrush and scissors

## Method:

### Step one - Design your lantern

* Think about the climate crisis, the people, places and things that you want to protect. Pick something personal to you or that touched you.
* Think of a simple a design mixing colours, words and images that will shine through lantern.  Think about how your words or design will shine through when lit from the inside.
* Prepare your materials, eg. using strips of coloured tissue paper, cut outs from [this newspaper](https://bit.ly/ClimateLanternPack), pens and thin paper.

### Step 2 - Make your lantern

* Wash and dry your jar
* Attach a handle around the rim of your lantern
* Paint a thin layer of glue on the outside of the jar with a paintbrush
* Place your design elements where you want them
* Cover with a final layer of glue and leave to dry

### Step 3 - Light your lantern at 6pm

* Tell your friends and neighbours and encourage them to make their own lanterns
* At 6pm on Friday 29th October, light your lantern in your window, on your doorstep or at one of several [vigils and memorial events](https://defundclimatechaos.uk/#map).
  * If you want to join with others, [organise your own memorial](https://defundclimatechaos.uk/#resources)
* Share a picture or short video message with your lantern on social media using **#ClimateMemorial** and **#DefundClimateChaos**
  * You can also **submit your best photo** [**here**](https://airtable.com/shrCvUWA9EhoEnjhf)

Just days before world leaders gather in Glasgow for last-chance COP26 climate talks, climate justice memorials will be laid outside some of the UK institutions with the most outsized impact on fuelling the climate crisis: banks, insurers and investors who fund fossil fuels.

We invite you to light your lantern for climate justice **every evening from 6pm on Friday 29th until the end of the COP26** climate talks on November 12th.
