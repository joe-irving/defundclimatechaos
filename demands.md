{% include accordion-start.html title="Keep it in the Ground - End fossil fuel expansion" %}

Achieving Climate justice means keeping fossil fuels in the ground. To keep below a 1.5°C increase and prevent irreparable social and ecological damage, we must prevent future fossil fuel extraction. We need to stop the further expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure and exploration. No more coal, oil, gas, fracking or biomass projects.

A rapid transition to a more just world will require huge investments - working people should not foot this bill, especially those hardest hit by climate disasters. It's time to properly tax rich individuals and giant corporations; this means implementing loophole-free progressive taxation and a Financial Transaction Tax* and for public institutions to use all the tools at their disposal to fund the green transition.

{% include accordion-start.html title="People Not Profit - Democratise our future" %}

Together, through public ownership and direct democracy, we need to transform our energy and financial sectors to build a system that works for everyone and ensures green low-cost energy access for all.
