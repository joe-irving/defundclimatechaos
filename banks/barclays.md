        There’s one organisation that can stop UK banks like Barclays/HSBC handing over cash to fossil fuel companies - the Bank of England. They’re already thinking about acting, but the banks are desperately trying to stop them changing the rules. 

        That’s why thousands of us are flooding the Bank of England, demanding that they take a stand, and stop banks funding fossil fuels. Send an email/tweet to the Bank of England now. There’s example text waiting for you if you’re not sure what to say:
