    - "Barclays big secret \U0001F92B: You’re still lending BILLIONS of dollars a
      year to the world’s worst fossil fuel companies. The same fossil fuel companies
      driving up our energy bills, making record profits, and making the climate crisis
      worse. When will you stop funding climate destruction? {{ page_url }} #DefundClimateChaos
      #StopJackdaw"
    - "It’ll be much easier to take you seriously when you stop lending billions of
      dollars to the fossil fuel industry. $167 BILLION since 2016?! \U0001F621 Until
      you stop funding fossil fuels you’re part of the problem. {{ page_url }} #DefundClimateChaos"
    - "I refuse to listen to anything you have to say while you’re still bankrolling
      fossil fuel companies. It’s ridiculous \U0001F92C. You can’t go on lending billions
      of dollars to the people causing the climate crisis, and expect to be taken
      seriously. #DefundClimateChaos"
    - Barclays is lending billions to fossil fuel companies. The companies causing
      climate change and making my bills sky-rocket. You’re just as responsible for
      climate destruction as the fossil fuel companies. When will you stop?
    - 'Hey Barclays - STOP giving billions of dollars to fossil fuel companies. You’re
      ruining our planet. #DefundClimateChaos'
    - "When are you going to stop giving money to Shell? \U0001F621 They’re causing
      the climate crisis AND at this very moment trying to drill in the North Sea
      for oil that won’t bring my bills down. Shame on you Barclays. {{ page_url }}
      #StopJackdaw"
    - "We must protect future generations. But you’re bankrolling the fossil fuel
      companies behind the climate crisis. You should be ashamed of yourself \U0001F6A8"

  blurb: |-
    There’s one organisation that can stop UK banks like HSBC handing over cash to fossil fuel companies - the Bank of England. They’re already thinking about acting, but the banks are desperately trying to stop them changing the rules.

    That’s why thousands of us are flooding the Bank of England, demanding that they take a stand, and stop banks funding fossil fuels. Send an email/tweet to the Bank of England now. There’s example text waiting for you if you’re not sure what to say:
