    # What’s happening?

    On the eve of UN climate talks in Glasgow, people-powered actions and climate justice memorials will make it clear - in location and message alike - at whose doorstep the blame for the loss and damage of climate injustice lies.

    On October 29, people around the world are joining together to demand that bankers, insurers and fund managers **Defund Climate Chaos**.

    It’s past time to turn off the money pipeline to oil, coal and gas companies and start investing in climate justice and a safer future for us all.

    # Why?

    ## With enough people power, we can force financiers to defund climate chaos. Join us.

    We all know that the climate crisis means code red for humanity. We see its raging fires, floods and storms around us every day now.

    Yet whilst the planet literally burns, the world’s biggest financiers keep pouring billions of pounds each year into fuelling the fire. They are failing us all.

    Climate justice demands that we shut off the money pipeline to oil, coal and gas immediately.
