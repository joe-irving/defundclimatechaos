# Partners

The youth climate movement has had enough, and they’re not the only ones. The 29th October is happening because groups across the world are coming together to make it happen.

Youth from communities on the frontlines of wildfires and floods, Indigenous frontline defenders, massive organisations and local community groups will all be out on the streets on the 29th Oct.

We are working closely with these allied networks all around the world as part of the[ Defund Climate Chaos global day of action](/).

Become a partner and [add your group to the list](#register-your-groups-support) of groups supporting the youth climate movement's call to action.
