    # Why?

    ## With enough people power, we can force financiers to defund climate chaos. Join us.

    We all know that the climate crisis means code red for humanity.  We see its raging fires, floods and storms around us every day now.

    Yet whilst the planet literally burns, the world’s biggest financiers keep pouring billions of pounds each year into fuelling the fire.  They are failing us all.

    Climate justice demands that we shut off the money pipeline to oil, coal and gas immediately.
