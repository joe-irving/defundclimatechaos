    # Why?

    ## **With enough people power, we can force financiers to defund climate chaos. Join us.**

    The climate crisis means “**code red for humanity**”. We see the reality raging around us with floods, wildfires and storms every day.

    Yet whilst the planet literally burns, the UK’s biggest financiers keep pouring billions of pounds each year into fuelling the fire. **Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds of London** to name just a few - they still fund fossil fuels.

    Climate justice demands that we harness our people power to shut off the money pipeline to oil, coal and gas immediately.
