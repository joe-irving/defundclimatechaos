    # What’s happening?

    People across the UK are rising up to demand that bankers, insurers and fund managers **Defund Climate Chaos**, pay **Climate Reparations** and fund a **Global Just Transition**.

    Every Spring, the finance industry comes together to hold their Annual General Meetings - where they celebrate profits, approve bonuses and ignore taking action to stop climate chaos.

    This year, we're taking mass action to disrupt business as usual at their AGMs. You can join communities on the frontlines of climate breakdown to take action against UK’s biggest funders of fossil fuel projects.

    > "We will target you, we will regulate you, we will prosecute you, we will dismantle the economic systems and systems of power that you maintain, we will force you to make reparations for the climate crisis and extractivism that you continue to enable around the world."

    It’s past time to turn off the money pipeline to oil, coal and gas companies and for UK finance to start investing in climate justice and a safer future for us all.

    # Why?

    ## **With enough people power, we can force financiers to defund climate chaos. Join us.**

    The climate crisis means “**code red for humanity**”. We see the reality raging around us with floods, wildfires and storms every day.

    Yet whilst the planet literally burns, the UK’s biggest financiers keep pouring billions of pounds each year into fuelling the fire. **Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds of London** to name just a few - they still fund fossil fuels.

    Climate justice demands that we harness our people power to shut off the money pipeline to oil, coal and gas immediately.

    ## Turn off the money pipeline to fossil fuels. Now.

    **Money is fuelling climate chaos**. Climate justice means keeping fossil fuels in the ground, right now. We need to stop new coal, oil, gas and fracking project

    **UK banks, investors and insurers are fuelling climate chaos** by pumping billions of pounds into climate wrecking projects each year. Without that support, companies like Shell and BP, can't operate.

    People around the world are rising up to demand that governments and corporations **#DefundClimateChaos**, pay **Climate Reparations** and fund a **Global** **Just Transition**
