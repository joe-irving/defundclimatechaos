    Barclays big secret ðŸ¤«: Youâ€™re still lending BILLIONS of dollars a year to the worldâ€™s worst fossil fuel companies. The same fossil fuel companies driving up our energy bills, making record profits, and making the climate crisis worse. When will you stop funding climate destruction? {{ page_url }} #DefundClimateChaos #StopJackdaw

    Itâ€™ll be much easier to take you seriously when you stop lending billions of dollars to the fossil fuel industry. $167 BILLION since 2016?! ðŸ˜¡ Until you stop funding fossil fuels youâ€™re part of the problem. {{ page_url }} #DefundClimateChaos

    I refuse to listen to anything you have to say while youâ€™re still bankrolling fossil fuel companies. Itâ€™s ridiculous ðŸ¤¬. You canâ€™t go on lending billions of dollars to the people causing the climate crisis, and expect to be taken seriously. #DefundClimateChaos

    Barclays is lending billions to fossil fuel companies. The companies causing climate change and making my bills sky-rocket. Youâ€™re just as responsible for climate destruction as the fossil fuel companies. When will you stop?

    Hey Barclays - STOP giving billions of dollars to fossil fuel companies. Youâ€™re ruining our planet. #DefundClimateChaos

    When are you going to stop giving money to Shell? ðŸ˜¡Â Theyâ€™re causing the climate crisis AND at this very moment trying to drill in the North Sea for oil that wonâ€™t bring my bills down. Shame on you Barclays. {{ page_url }} #StopJackdaw

    We must protect future generations. But youâ€™re bankrolling the fossil fuel companies behind the climate crisis. You should be ashamed of yourself ðŸš¨

## What next?

Thereâ€™s one organisation that can stop UK banks like Barclays/HSBC handing over cash to fossil fuel companies - the Bank of England. Theyâ€™re already thinking about acting, but the banks are desperately trying to stop them changing the rules. 

Thatâ€™s why thousands of us are flooding the Bank of England, demanding that they take a stand, and stop banks funding fossil fuels. Send an email/tweet to the Bank of England now. Thereâ€™s example text waiting for you if youâ€™re not sure what to say.
