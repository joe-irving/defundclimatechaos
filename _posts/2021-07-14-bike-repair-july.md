## 1pm to 5pm on Saturday 17th July

Come along to fix your broken bikes, or share your skills.

We will be outside the evicted Barbican Community Centre on Paragon Street - near Coop. What 3 Words: ///former.showed.owner.

Please contact us on [barbican@bicycle.ga](mailto:barbican@bicycle.ga) if you have any tools to share! We especially need a bike stand right now.

Pay as you feel :)

Make sure you are on [our email list](https://barbican.earth/list) for updates.
