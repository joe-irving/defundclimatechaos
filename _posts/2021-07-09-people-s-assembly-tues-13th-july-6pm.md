We’re hosting a People’s Assembly for the People of York to discuss the future of the Barbican Community Centre (BCC), founded during the recent occupation of the neglected land beside the York Barbican. This is your chance to share your views on how this land could best be used to serve the local community.

**We’ll be discussing:**

* The needs of the local community and how might the Barbican Community Centre serve them?
* The future of the Barbican site, and other potential sites for community spaces in York
* How we can go about building a new community space for the city

We believe the local community strongly supports the Barbican site being used for the People of York, but we want to hear from as many people as possible first. So bring your friends and family along and have your voice heard

There will also be the option of joining the sister event on Zoom, which you can [sign up for on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-barbican-community-centres-peoples-assembly-tickets-163114099663).

We will be in the upstairs community venue in SPARK. See the map below
