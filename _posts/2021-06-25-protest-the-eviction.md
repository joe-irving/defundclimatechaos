Last week the People of York occupied 2.2 acres of derelict brownfield land in the heart of our city and opened the Barbican Community Centre. We are turning it into a Community allotment, a pay-as-you-feel food waste cafe, an affordable eco-housing site, a Community library, an arts and events space, and a People's Assembly. It had been neglected for 15 years by Persimmon Homes, who want to sell it to develop more student apartments for £20 million.

At 6:30am Friday we were illegally and violently evicted by Court Enforcement Specialists Limited at the direction of Persimmon Homes.

We Demand:

* The council use a Compulsory Purchase Order to buy back the land for £1 and give it back to the People of York
* Rescind planning permission for all new hotels and luxury apartments and begin a massive program of building carbon negative social housing
* A People's Assembly to give power back to the People of York with deliberative direct democracy

Join us at 1pm tomorrow at the **Barbican Community Centre** at the entrance opposite the city walls to protest Persimmon Homes and our illegal eviction.
