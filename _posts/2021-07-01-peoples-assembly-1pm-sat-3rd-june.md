We are hosting a people's assembly, open to anyone in York, to discuss the future of the Barbican Community Centre (BCC), which was founded during the recent occupation of the the neglected land beside the York Barbican. It was clear over the course of the occupation that the local community strongly supports the Barbican site being used for the People of York, and that there is a significant need for such community-centred spaces. As a result, following the [violent eviction by Persimmon Homes](/news/press-release-eviction-protest/) of this site, there is a need to reflect and deliberate as a community on our next steps. Specifically, the questions this assembly will address are:

* What are the needs of the local community and how might the Barbican Community Centre serve them?
* Should we fight to acquire the Barbican site from Persimmon Homes, and how should we go about doing that?
* Should we attempt to find a new site, and if so what kind of site do we want and what options are available?

We will do our best to adapt to the weather (a bit rainy) and make it fun, family friendly and with lots of opportunities to talk and speak in a less structured fashion. Even if you can only turn up for a bit it would be amazing to have you there.
