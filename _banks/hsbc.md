  ### HSBC HAS LENT £103 BILLION TO FOSSIL FUELS SINCE 2016

  Yup, HSBC are one of the worst out there. They’re giving billions to fossil fuel companies every year. That includes billions to groups like Saudi Aramco, the Saudi government’s oil company. Together, we're demanding that HSBC stops bankrolling climate destruction.

    There’s one organisation that can stop UK banks like HSBC handing over cash to fossil fuel companies - the Bank of England. They’re already thinking about acting, but the banks are desperately trying to stop them changing the rules.

    That’s why thousands of us are flooding the Bank of England, demanding that they take a stand, and stop banks funding fossil fuels. Send an email to the Bank of England now. There’s example text waiting for you if you’re not sure what to say:

  content: "# HSBC HAS LENT £103 BILLION TO FOSSIL FUELS SINCE 2016 \U0001F92C\n\nYup,
    HSBC are one of the worst out there. They’re giving billions to fossil fuel companies
    every year. That includes billions to groups like Saudi Aramco, the Saudi government’s
    oil company. They’re the worst fossil fuel drillers in the world - they said they
    want to drill “every last drop”. HSBC are also the worst in Europe for funding
    NEW fossil fuels. That means more oil rigs, more habitats destroyed, and more
    climate change. It’s time to join the movement and ditch HSBC \U0001F4AA\U0001F3FE"
