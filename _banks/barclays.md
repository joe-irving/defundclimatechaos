        There’s one organisation that can stop UK banks like Barclays/HSBC handing over cash to fossil fuel companies - the Bank of England. They’re already thinking about acting, but the banks are desperately trying to stop them changing the rules. 

        That’s why thousands of us are flooding the Bank of England, demanding that they take a stand, and stop banks funding fossil fuels. Send an email/tweet to the Bank of England now. There’s example text waiting for you if you’re not sure what to say:

        Barclays have ploughed $167 billion into fossil fuels since 2016. You read that right, billions. That’s why they’re the worst in Europe. And they’re continuing to pour billions into NEW fossil fuels. That means more oil rigs, more habitats destroyed, and more climate change. You’re in a toxic relationship with Barclays. It’s time to get out.
