- title: TU Model Motion
  content: "This Trade Union Council / Branch / conference / AGM is very concerned
    at the outcomes of the COP26 Climate talks in Glasgow as they:\n* Failed to put
    an end to the expansion of fossil fuels\n* Failed to tackle the UK finance sector’s
    funding and insurance of fossil fuels.\n \nNew fossil fuel projects will blow
    us past our safe climate limits. If we want a liveable climate – meaning temperatures
    rise no more than 1.5°C – there can be no new investment in oil, gas or coal.
    A radical shift to a carbon-neutral sustainable economy & society must start now
    via a Just Transition. Workers and communities directly affected across the world
    and in the UK should not pay the price of the necessary transition. The Finance
    industry - banks, insurers and fund managers -  must be held to account for their
    crucial role in funding climate chaos.\nAs Trade Unionists, we believe that:\n
    Climate justice means keeping fossil fuels in the ground, right now. We need to
    stop new coal, oil, gas and fracking projects.\nBanks, insurers and other private
    financiers must stop supporting and profiting from fossil fuel extraction, false
    solutions like biomass or carbon capture and storage and new infrastructure like
    roads and airports.\nPublic money must stop being given to polluting industries,
    through our central banks, pension funds, and government subsidies.\nPolluters
    and finance executives that are profiting from causing climate chaos, must pay
    climate reparations, for the harms they drive around the world.\nWe need a financial
    transaction Tax to support to invest in good, green jobs, especially for workers
    transitioning from high carbon industries and projects and those hit the hardest
    by climate impacts, Covid-19, and precarity\nTogether we need to democratise the
    financial industry to force a just transition and ensure energy access for all.\nThis
    Trade Union Council / Branch / conference / AGM therefore agrees to:\n Support
    campaigns to end fossil fuel projects such as North Sea Oil projects like the
    Cambo field, West Cumbria coal mine, East Africa Pipeline, and the Trans Mountain
    Pipeline. \nRaise the profile of the issue of Fossil Finances with members, affiliates
    and partners by sharing resources, running briefing sessions, participating to
    relevant events and/or lobby politicians on the issue.\nSign up/ donate to the
    Defund Climate Chaos coalition and support events targeting the financial institutions
    behind fossil fuel investments\nCirculate the latest version of this motion and
    info pack to affiliates/branches/members for them to escalate it to their Trade
    Unions (Branches, Regional Committees and Conferences, Equalities networks conferences,
    National conferences and up to the Trade Union Congress if possible)\n"
