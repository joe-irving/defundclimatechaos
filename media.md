## Spokespeople

**Mitzi Jonelle Tan, Fridays for Future Philippines**

> ‘For me this is personal. I know the families in Bulacan, Philippines forced from their homes because of a project funded by Standard Chartered Bank. That’s why I’ve travelled thousands of miles to stand on the steps of the bank’s HQ in the City of London and demand they defund fossil fuel.’

**Joseph Sikulu, Pacific Climate Warriors / 350 Pacific**

> Financial institutions that continue to invest in dirty fossil fuel projects are also investing in the destruction of our islands and our homes. It’s time for the corporations who have caused this crisis to be held accountable. The science is clear. We need to do everything we can to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, the survival of our islands depends on that. To get there we need to defund the climate chaos.
