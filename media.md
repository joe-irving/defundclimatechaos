## Spokespeople

**Mitzi Jonelle Tan, Fridays for Future Philippines**

> ‘For me this is personal. I know the families in Bulacan, Philippines forced from their homes because of a project funded by Standard Chartered Bank. That’s why I’ve travelled thousands of miles to stand on the steps of the bank’s HQ in the City of London and demand they defund fossil fuel.’

**Joseph Sikulu, Pacific Climate Warriors / 350 Pacific**

> Financial institutions that continue to invest in dirty fossil fuel projects are also investing in the destruction of our islands and our homes. It’s time for the corporations who have caused this crisis to be held accountable. The science is clear. We need to do everything we can to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, the survival of our islands depends on that. To get there we need to defund the climate chaos.

## Press Release

# **EMBARGOED UNTIL 00.01 FRIDAY 29TH OCTOBER**

## **Greta joins campaigners in City of London to demand Big Finance defunds fossil fuels**

* **Young campaigners put global finance centre stage on the eve of UN Climate Change Conference to stop the flow of money into fossil fuel extraction for good**
* **Activists reveal banks have poured $3.8 trillion into fossil fuel extraction since the 2015 Paris agreement.**
* **Protests will be held at over 50 locations across the planet as part of the biggest climate finance action in history - including major global financial centres across Europe and North America, Africa and Australia**
* **Communities from the climate frontlines will travel to the City of London to take the fight to the doorsteps of the big banks and insurers funding fossil fuels around the world.** 
* **Giant murals will be painted in global financial centres using ash from houses and forests destroyed in wildfires.** 
* **Activists will take part in climate memorials outside major banks and insurers with a candle-lit vigil taking place at the Bank of England.**

Thousands of people are set to take part in more than 50 protests spanning 26 countries and every continent on the planet - in a truly global initiative - to demand the global financial system stops the flow of money into fossil fuels. The protests will take place at major global financial centres London, New York, Frankfurt as well as other locations from Manila to San Francisco, São Paulo to Nairobi, the South Pacific and across Europe.

The Day of Action is set to be the largest climate finance protest in history. The organisers from 15 movements represent millions of people from the South Pacific to the Arctic. They will take part in climate memorials outside Standard Chartered, Barclays, Lloyds of London and the Bank of England in London. In the US the focus of protests will be JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and Blackrock. While in Frankfurt, Germany, it will target Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, Sparkasse, and the European Central Bank.

World leaders signed the Paris Agreement in 2015, committing to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5°C. To get there The International Energy Authority (IEA) says there can be no further exploration of oil and gas after this year. That’s the minimum.

But since the 2015 Paris Agreement, banks have provided $3.8 trillion in loans and investment for projects extracting new fossil fuels from the ground,

Among those planning to take part in the Day of Action are Greta Thunberg; Vanessa Nakate; Steve Melia, a former Bank of America executive; The Pacific Climate Warriors, an indigenous community travelling from the Pacific Islands; and Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a young fridays for Future activist from the Philippines. All tare aking part in City of London actions throughout the day. Please get in touch for first bids.

**Steve Melia, activist and former VP of Bank of America stated:**

> "While fossil fuel companies are obvious culprits of climate destruction, there’s a villain behind the scenes: the financial institutions who support them. Banks need to stop lending and insuring the companies extracting fossil fuels. Many people are unaware that their savings or pensions are invested in dirty assets. Fossil fuel investments are like the sub-prime mortgages which triggered the global recession in the late 2000s. Their value will collapse at some point in the future - the only thing we can't predict is when."

**Joseph Sikulu, Pacific Climate Warriors said:**

> "Financial institutions that continue to invest in dirty fossil fuel projects are also investing in the destruction of our islands and our homes. It’s time for the corporations who have caused this crisis to be held accountable. The science is clear. We need to do everything we can to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, the survival of our islands depends on that. To get there we need to defund the climate chaos. "

**Mitzi Jonelle Tan, activist said:**

> ‘For me this is personal. I know the families in Bulacan, Philippines forced from their homes because of a project funded by Standard Chartered Bank. That’s why I’ve travelled thousands of miles to stand on the steps of the bank’s HQ in the City of London and demand they defund fossil fuel.’

Teams of specially trained activists will create giant murals and memorials to remember the 5 million people killed by extreme weather every year. Their lives will be commemorated with climate justice lanterns, testimonies and murals painted with ash from forest fires and mud from recent floods.

Climate breakdown has already taken the lives of millions of people around the world. Extreme weather has been linked to nearly 10% of global deaths - resulting in around five million deaths every year. (1)

The global day of action will be a moment to honour their memories and ensure that they did not die in vain. Activists will call on financial institutions to honour them by committing to cease funding fossil fuels.
